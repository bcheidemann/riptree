riptree (rt)
------------

riptree is a Rust rewrite of the Unix tree command. It aims to be a drop in
replacement (`alias tree="rt --compat"`) with some quality of life improvements,
such as automatically respecting ignore files.

# Current Status

riptree is under active development. The basic tree functionality has been
implemented, but most options are not supported yet.
